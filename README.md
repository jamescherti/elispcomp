# elispcomp - Compile Emacs Lisp code from the command-line

(The author also recommends trying: **[compile-angel.el](https://github.com/jamescherti/compile-angel.el)**, an Emacs package that automatically byte-compiles and native-compiles .el Elisp libraries, transparently, without any user intervention.)

## Introduction

The `elispcomp` command line tool allows compiling Emacs Lisp (Elisp) code directly from the terminal or from a shell script. It facilitates the generation of optimized `.elc` (byte-compiled) and `.eln` (native-compiled) files, which can significantly improve the performance of Emacs.

The command line tool executes a headless instance of Emacs and Elisp that recursively scans the specified directories, byte compiling and native compiling all the `.el` files that haven't been compiled yet. It supports various configuration options, allowing you to adapt the compilation process to suit your needs.

When configured appropriately, Emacs can compile to both `.elc` and `.eln` files. However, for those who wish to automate the background compilation of `.el` files using a script, the `elispcomp` command-line tool can be beneficial in ensuring that their Emacs setup remains up-to-date without manual intervention and without starting an Emacs instance.

## Installation

To get started with `elispcomp`, you can install it using `pip`:
```
pip install --user elispcomp
```

This command installs `elispcomp` and places the executable in your `~/.local/bin/` directory, making it easily accessible from your command line.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Emacs >= 28

## Usage

The `elispcomp` command line tool is straightforward to use.

First example: To compile all `.el` files located in the `~/.emacs.d/lisp` directory:
```
elispcomp ~/.emacs.d/lisp
```

Second example: To compile all `.el` files located in the `~/.emacs.d/lisp` directory, and store the native-compiled files in the `~/.emacs.d/eln-cache` directory:
```
elispcomp --eln-cache ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache ~/.emacs.d/lisp
```

## Command line options

```
usage: elispcomp [--option] [N]

Recursively byte and native compile .el files.

positional arguments:
  N                     The directories to be scanned recursively by Emacs to locate the '.el'
                        files for compilation.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c ELN_CACHE, --eln-cache ELN_CACHE
                        The eln-cache directory where Emacs stores the compiled native compiled
                        code. Defaults to the default Emacs eln-cache directory.
  -e EMACS_BIN, --emacs-bin EMACS_BIN
                        Path to the Emacs binary. Defaults: emacs
  -j JOBS, --jobs JOBS  Specify the number of parallel jobs for compilation. Default: Half the
                        number of available CPUs
  -b, --disable-byte-compile, --disable-byte-comp
                        Disable byte compile. Default: enabled
  -n, --disable-native-compile, --disable-native-comp
                        Disable native compilation. Default: enabled
  -i LOAD_PATH, --load-path LOAD_PATH
                        Recursively adds the subdirectories of the specified directory to the
                        Emacs `load-path`. This option can be used multiple times to include
                        several directories.
  -a, --ensure-native-compile-available, --ensure-native-comp-available
                        Fail when native compilation is not available.
```

## Frequently asked questions

### Can't I achieve the same result using Emacs?

Indeed, when configured appropriately, Emacs can compile to both `.elc` and `.eln` files.

The `elispcomp` command-line tool is an Emacs wrapper that makes it easy to compile Emacs Lisp (Elisp) code directly from the terminal or from a script. It provides options and ensures that the byte compilation and native compilation processes are truly finished before quitting.

The `elispcomp` command-line tool can also be used in conjunction with other tools like `parallel` to speed up the compilation process.

### How does the author utilize elispcomp?

The author utilizes the `elispcomp` tool to compile multiple Emacs Lisp files across various machines and Emacs versions. With a diverse range of machines and Emacs versions in his workflow, `elispcomp` ensures consistent compilation results and compatibility.

Additionally, the author employs the `parallel` command-line tool to enhance the efficiency of the byte-compilation process. This tool allows the distribution of the compilation workload across multiple processors, significantly accelerating the process.

### Is elispcomp written in Python or Elisp?

Most of what `elispcomp` does is written in Elisp (Emacs Lisp), including scanning directories, which is handled by the Emacs functions `(byte-recompile-directory)` and `(native-compile-async)`. Python handles the command-line interface (arguments), and Emacs and the Elisp code does the rest (byte compilation, native compilation, and waiting until all the .el files are byte compiled and native compiled).
